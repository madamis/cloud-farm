### Problem
Combining farming and 7-5 job has been a daunting task usually one suffers and most of the time is farming that starves due to pressure from bosses and convenience as well. The unpredictability of the outcome also minimizes the chances of making it in agriculture. That's why you can be saying you have been farming for many years with nothing to show and thinking of giving up.

# Managing to farm has been a difficult task.
... ** Finding reliable farm managers. 
Lack of forecast on the investments and outputs
Pest and disease management
Finding and Managing laborers
Managing farm activities
Most of the time people just grow crops or rear animals without a proper forecast or to say without a business plan. They do not know when they are making losses and or if they are going to make profits. Keeping Farm records has not been easy as well. 

Solution
We want to be the farm managers. Others may join us to be farm managers as well. We will be giving Clients a well forecast business plan, and be with both Client and farm manager throughout the farming process. The client will fund the farming season for his manageable and chosen type of farming. During this, we will provide with them solutions to different stages of the farming process. 

We will rent a big site with different clientsâ€™ money and a farm proportional to each client's contribution. We take the money in advance to secure the funding for the entire farming season.

Similarly, we will have a big kraal with different people's animals. Each being raised aware of the owner. 

Clients will also be able to just subscribe to our calendar for the activities timeline and email reminders at a small fee and be doing every activity themselves.

We are exploring on looking for markets of products made from these farms.
